- **Development Principles**: Feature-slice approach with no mock/prototype implementations
- **Project Structure**: Defined folder structure for source code, tests, and content
- **Backlog Management**: System for tracking and managing development progress

### ✅ Claude Code Best Practices Integration (Backlog Item #2)
- **Development Workflow**: Explore-Plan-Code-Commit approach with TDD guidelines
- **Environment Setup**: Required tools and configuration for AI-driven development
- **Optimization Techniques**: Effective communication patterns and tool integration
- **Advanced Development Patterns**: Parallel development, headless mode, and thinking modes
- **Code Standards**: AI analysis-specific conventions and testing guidelines
