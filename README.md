1. Open a moment file in `moments/` folder with a text editor
2. Edit the title or description in the YAML frontmatter
3. Save the file and return to the Moments app
4. Use "Load from Files" in Storage Manager to refresh from files
5. Verify your changes appear in the moment card

**Scenario 5: Configuration Verification**
1. Check `config.yml` for moments configuration section
2. Verify `auto_save: true` and `sync_mode: "bidirectional"`
3. Test changing `auto_save: false` and confirm moments don't auto-save
4. Test different file patterns or folder paths

**File Structure to Evaluate:**

**Folder Organization:**
- `moments/` folder should be created automatically
- Files should follow naming pattern: `2024-01-15-c-openai-partnership-abc12345.md`
- Each file should be self-contained with complete moment data

**File Content Structure:**
```markdown
---
id: unique-moment-id
title: "Moment Title"
description: "Description"
extractedAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
source:
  type: company
  name: "Company Name"
  # ... complete source metadata
classification:
  microFactors: ["company", "partners"]
  macroFactors: ["technology"]
  confidence: "high"
  reasoning: "AI analysis reasoning"
  keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
impact:
  score: 85
  reasoning: "Impact analysis"
entities:
  companies: ["Company1", "Company2"]
  technologies: ["Tech1", "Tech2"]
  # ... etc
---

# Moment Title

Brief description...

## Analysis Summary
[Readable analysis content]
```

**Configuration Options to Test:**

**In `config.yml`:**
```yaml
catalogs:
  moments:
    auto_save: true          # Test enabling/disabling auto-save
    sync_mode: "bidirectional"  # Test "one-way" vs "bidirectional"
    metadata_format: "frontmatter"  # YAML frontmatter format
    file_patterns: ["*.md", "*.mdx"]  # Test different patterns
```

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Moment files are automatically created in `moments/` folder
- ‚úÖ Files contain complete moment data in YAML frontmatter
- ‚úÖ Markdown content is human-readable with structured analysis
- ‚úÖ App successfully loads moments from files on startup
- ‚úÖ File Management UI provides easy save/load operations
- ‚úÖ Manual file edits are preserved when loading from files
- ‚úÖ Configuration options work as expected
- ‚úÖ No data loss when switching between memory and file storage

**Advanced Features to Test:**

**Bidirectional Sync:**
- Files ‚Üí Memory: Changes to files appear in app after "Load from Files"
- Memory ‚Üí Files: New moments automatically save to files (if auto_save enabled)
- Mixed operations: Some moments from analysis, some edited manually

**Error Handling:**
- Invalid YAML frontmatter in moment files
- Missing or corrupted moment files
- Filesystem permissions issues
- Large numbers of moment files (performance)

**Performance Testing:**
- Time to save large numbers of moments to files
- Loading speed with many moment files in folder
- Memory usage with file-based persistence enabled
- Browser storage usage before/after file persistence

**Integration Testing:**
- Moment detail views work with file-loaded moments
- Entity navigation works with file-persisted moments
- Keyword filtering works across file and memory moments
- Related moments correlation works with mixed sources

**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

**Moments Not Saving to Files:**
- Check config.yml has `auto_save: true`
- Verify filesystem write permissions in moments/ folder
- Check browser console for save operation errors
- Use Storage Manager "Save to Files" as fallback

**Moments Not Loading from Files:**
- Verify `sync_mode: "bidirectional"` in config.yml
- Check moment files have valid YAML frontmatter
- Look for hydration errors in browser console
- Try "Load from Files" in Storage Manager manually

**File Format Issues:**
- Ensure YAML frontmatter is properly formatted with `---` delimiters
- Check all required fields are present (id, title, extractedAt)
- Verify date formats are ISO strings
- Validate enum values (confidence, etc.)

**Performance Issues:**
- Monitor filesystem operations in browser dev tools
- Check for excessive save/load operations
- Test with representative numbers of moment files
- Use "Inspect Storage" to check memory usage

This file-based persistence system provides a robust foundation for moments data management, ensuring your AI analysis results are preserved as human-readable files that can be version controlled, edited manually, and shared across different environments.
