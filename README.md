1. Open a moment file in `moments/` folder with a text editor
2. Edit the title or description in the YAML frontmatter
3. Save the file and return to the Moments app
4. Use "Load from Files" in Storage Manager to refresh from files
5. Verify your changes appear in the moment card

**Scenario 5: Configuration Verification**
1. Check `config.yml` for moments configuration section
2. Verify `auto_save: true` and `sync_mode: "bidirectional"`
3. Test changing `auto_save: false` and confirm moments don't auto-save
4. Test different file patterns or folder paths

**File Structure to Evaluate:**

**Folder Organization:**
- `moments/` folder should be created automatically
- Files should follow naming pattern: `2024-01-15-c-openai-partnership-abc12345.md`
- Each file should be self-contained with complete moment data

**File Content Structure:**
```markdown

## Analysis Summary
[Readable analysis content]
```

**Configuration Options to Test:**

**In `config.yml`:**
```yaml
catalogs:
  moments:
    auto_save: true          # Test enabling/disabling auto-save
    sync_mode: "bidirectional"  # Test "one-way" vs "bidirectional"
    metadata_format: "frontmatter"  # YAML frontmatter format
    file_patterns: ["*.md", "*.mdx"]  # Test different patterns
```

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Moment files are automatically created in `moments/` folder
- ‚úÖ Files contain complete moment data in YAML frontmatter
- ‚úÖ Markdown content is human-readable with structured analysis
- ‚úÖ App successfully loads moments from files on startup
- ‚úÖ File Management UI provides easy save/load operations
- ‚úÖ Manual file edits are preserved when loading from files
- ‚úÖ Configuration options work as expected
- ‚úÖ No data loss when switching between memory and file storage

**Advanced Features to Test:**

**Bidirectional Sync:**
- Files ‚Üí Memory: Changes to files appear in app after "Load from Files"
- Memory ‚Üí Files: New moments automatically save to files (if auto_save enabled)
- Mixed operations: Some moments from analysis, some edited manually

**Error Handling:**
- Invalid YAML frontmatter in moment files
- Missing or corrupted moment files
- Filesystem permissions issues
- Large numbers of moment files (performance)

**Performance Testing:**

- Loading speed with many moment files in folder
- Memory usage with file-based persistence enabled
- Browser storage usage before/after file persistence

**Integration Testing:**
- Moment detail views work with file-loaded moments
- Entity navigation works with file-persisted moments
- Keyword filtering works across file and memory moments
- Related moments correlation works with mixed sources

**Troubleshooting Common Issues:**

**Moments Not Saving to Files:**
- Check config.yml has `auto_save: true`
- Verify filesystem write permissions in moments/ folder
- Check browser console for save operation errors
- Use Storage Manager "Save to Files" as fallback

**Moments Not Loading from Files:**
- Verify `sync_mode: "bidirectional"` in config.yml
- Check moment files have valid YAML frontmatter
- Look for hydration errors in browser console
- Try "Load from Files" in Storage Manager manually

**File Format Issues:**
- Ensure YAML frontmatter is properly formatted with `---` delimiters
- Check all required fields are present (id, title, extractedAt)
- Verify date formats are ISO strings
- Validate enum values (confidence, etc.)

**Performance Issues:**
- Monitor filesystem operations in browser dev tools
- Check for excessive save/load operations
- Test with representative numbers of moment files
- Use "Inspect Storage" to check memory usage

This file-based persistence system provides a robust foundation for moments data management, ensuring your AI analysis results are preserved as human-readable files that can be version controlled, edited manually, and shared across different environments.

### Testing File-System-First Persistence Architecture

The latest major architectural update transforms Moments from localStorage-primary to file-system-first persistence, making the filesystem the single source of truth for all catalog data (companies, technologies, and moments).

#### 14. Enhanced Persistence Architecture

**What Changed:**
- **Primary Storage**: Filesystem is now the authoritative source for all catalog data
- **Caching Role**: localStorage is used only for performance optimization and temporary storage
- **Unified API**: Consistent file operations across all catalog types
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Seamless transition from old localStorage-primary to new file-first architecture

**What to Test:**

**File-System-First Loading:**
1. **Fresh Start**: Clear browser storage completely (dev tools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear site data)
2. **Automatic Hydration**: Refresh the app and observe loading behavior
3. **Source Priority**: Check browser console logs for "Loading from file system first" messages
4. **Fallback Behavior**: Verify localStorage is used only for caching, not primary storage

**Enhanced Configuration:**
1. **Persistence Settings**: Check `config.yml` for new persistence configuration
   - `persistence.strategy: "file_system_first"`
   - Individual catalog `persistence_mode: "file_primary"`
   - `cache_enabled: true` for performance optimization
2. **Cache Configuration**: Verify cache TTL settings and behavior
3. **Auto-sync Settings**: Test `auto_sync: true` functionality

**Storage Manager Integration:**
1. **Enhanced Health Check**: Storage Manager now shows both localStorage AND filesystem status
2. **Filesystem Metrics**: Check file counts and folder readiness indicators
3. **Dual Status Display**: Verify both cache health and file system health are shown
4. **Error Handling**: Test behavior when filesystem is unavailable

**Testing Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: File-First vs Cache-First Comparison**
1. **Before**: Load app with existing localStorage data
2. **Clear Cache**: Use Storage Manager to clear localStorage only
3. **Reload App**: App should load from filesystem, not show empty state
4. **Performance**: Observe that data appears immediately (loaded from files, cached to localStorage)

**Scenario 2: Cache Performance Validation**
1. **Initial Load**: First app load reads from filesystem and caches in localStorage
2. **Subsequent Loads**: Verify localStorage cache is used for immediate display
3. **Cache Invalidation**: Test that stale cache is refreshed from filesystem when needed
4. **Cache Health**: Monitor storage health shows both cache size and file system status

**Scenario 3: Data Source Verification**
1. **Modify Files**: Edit a moment file directly in `moments/` folder
2. **Clear Cache**: Clear localStorage using Storage Manager
3. **Reload App**: Verify file changes appear in the app
4. **Cache Refresh**: Confirm modified data is cached for subsequent loads

**Scenario 4: Migration from Old Architecture**
1. **Existing Users**: App should work normally for users with existing localStorage data
2. **Gradual Transition**: New data prioritizes filesystem while preserving existing data
3. **No Data Loss**: Verify no existing moments, companies, or technologies are lost
4. **Background Migration**: Existing data is gradually migrated to file-first approach

**Expected Benefits:**

**Data Reliability:**
- ‚úÖ Data survives browser storage clearing
- ‚úÖ Content persists across different browsers/devices (same filesystem)
- ‚úÖ Manual file editing is immediately reflected in the app
- ‚úÖ Version control friendly (files can be committed to git)

**Performance Optimization:**
- ‚úÖ Immediate display using localStorage cache
- ‚úÖ Background file system sync for persistence
- ‚úÖ Intelligent cache invalidation prevents stale data
- ‚úÖ Reduced browser storage consumption (files stored externally)

**Developer Experience:**
- ‚úÖ Human-readable data files for debugging
- ‚úÖ Direct file manipulation for testing/development
- ‚úÖ Clear separation between cache and source of truth
- ‚úÖ Consistent API across all catalog types

**Configuration Testing:**

**Test Different Persistence Strategies:**
```yaml
# In config.yml, test different strategies
persistence:
  strategy: "file_system_first"  # Test primary behavior
  # strategy: "local_storage_first"  # Test legacy mode
  # strategy: "hybrid"  # Test balanced approach
```

**Cache Settings Validation:**
```yaml
cache:
  enabled: true  # Test with caching enabled/disabled
  default_ttl_seconds: 3600  # Test different TTL values
  max_size_mb: 50  # Test cache size limits
```

**Per-Catalog Configuration:**
```yaml
catalogs:
  companies:
    persistence_mode: "file_primary"  # Test file-first for companies
    cache_enabled: true  # Test caching behavior
  moments:
    persistence_mode: "hybrid"  # Test mixed approach for moments
```

**Advanced Testing:**

**Performance Metrics:**
- File system operations: < 200ms for typical datasets
- Cache hits: < 10ms response time
- Cache misses: Graceful fallback to filesystem
- Storage health checks: < 100ms including filesystem status

**Error Scenarios:**
- Filesystem unavailable: Graceful degradation to cache-only mode
- Corrupted files: Automatic error recovery with detailed logging
- Cache quota exceeded: Automatic cleanup and file-priority fallback
- Mixed data sources: Proper merging and conflict resolution

**Integration Validation:**
- All existing features work with file-first persistence
- Moment detail views display file-loaded data correctly  
- Entity navigation works across file and cache sources
- Correlation discovery works with mixed data sources
- Export/import operations respect file-first architecture

**Troubleshooting Guide:**

**Issue: Data Not Loading from Files**
- Check `config.yml` has `persistence.strategy: "file_system_first"`
- Verify filesystem permissions for reading catalog folders
- Check browser console for file loading error messages
- Use Storage Manager to inspect filesystem status

**Issue: Cache Not Working**
- Verify `cache.enabled: true` in configuration
- Check localStorage quota and available space
- Monitor cache hit/miss ratios in browser dev tools
- Test with different cache TTL settings

**Issue: Mixed Data Sources**
- Some data from files, some from cache - this is expected during migration
- Use "Load from Files" in Storage Manager to force file reload
- Clear localStorage to test pure file-first behavior
- Check console logs for data source information

This architectural transformation ensures Moments provides enterprise-grade data reliability while maintaining the performance benefits of intelligent caching, creating a robust foundation for local-first AI business intelligence applications.

### Testing Incremental Moments Generation System

The latest update introduces intelligent incremental analysis that dramatically improves performance by processing only changed content instead of re-analyzing everything from scratch.

#### 15. Incremental Analysis Features

**What to Test:**
- **Smart Content Detection**: System tracks content changes using MD5 hashing and only processes new/modified items
- **Temporal Correlation Windows**: Advanced correlation analysis within configurable time windows (default 14 days)
- **Intelligent UI**: "Smart Update" vs "Full Refresh" buttons with incremental stats display
- **Cache Management**: Clear incremental cache to force full re-analysis when needed

**How It Works:**
1. **Change Detection**: System maintains content hashes to identify what has changed since last analysis
2. **Incremental Processing**: Only processes new or modified content, preserving existing analysis
3. **Correlation Updates**: Updates correlations within affected temporal windows
4. **Smart Merging**: Combines existing moments with newly discovered ones

**Testing Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Initial Analysis (Baseline)**
1. **Fresh Start**: Clear all data and start with clean catalogs
2. **Run Full Analysis**: Click "Full Analysis" button to establish baseline
3. **Note Performance**: Record analysis time and moment count (e.g., "18 moments in 45 seconds")
4. **Observe Files**: Check that moments are saved to `moments/` folder
5. **Check Incremental Stats**: Note "Tracked Content" count in status card

**Scenario 2: No-Change Incremental Analysis**
1. **Immediate Re-run**: Click "Smart Update" immediately after initial analysis
2. **Expected Behavior**: Should complete very quickly with "No changes detected" message
3. **Moment Preservation**: Verify same moment count and data
4. **Performance**: Should complete in < 5 seconds (vs 45 seconds for full analysis)

**Scenario 3: Content Change Detection**
1. **Modify Content**: Edit a markdown file in `companies/` or `technologies/` folder
2. **Add New Content**: Create a new markdown file with business-relevant information
3. **Run Smart Update**: Click "Smart Update" button
4. **Observe Processing**: Should process only changed files, not all content
5. **Verify Results**: New moments appear while existing ones are preserved
6. **Check Correlation**: Related moments should have updated impact scores

**Scenario 4: Force Full Re-analysis**
1. **Change Multiple Files**: Modify several content files significantly
2. **Click "Full Refresh"**: Use force full analysis option
3. **Compare Performance**: Should take longer but be more comprehensive than Smart Update
4. **Verify Accuracy**: All moments should be re-analyzed with current content

**Scenario 5: Incremental Cache Management**
1. **View Stats**: Check incremental status card for tracked content count and last update
2. **Clear Cache**: Click "Reset Cache" button to clear change detection
3. **Next Analysis**: Verify next "Smart Update" becomes full analysis (no change history)
4. **Re-establish Tracking**: Subsequent analyses should again be incremental

**User Interface Elements to Evaluate:**

**Incremental Analysis Buttons:**
- **"Smart Update"**: Primary button for incremental analysis
- **"Full Refresh"**: Secondary button for complete re-analysis  
- **"Reset Cache"**: Small button to clear incremental cache

**Incremental Status Card:**
- **Blue background**: Indicates incremental analysis is active
- **Tracked Content**: Number of files being monitored for changes
- **Temporal Window**: Shows correlation window (14 days default)
- **Last Update**: Timestamp of most recent analysis

**Expected Performance Benefits:**

**Time Comparison:**
- **Full Analysis**: 30-60 seconds for typical dataset
- **Smart Update (no changes)**: 2-5 seconds
- **Smart Update (few changes)**: 5-15 seconds
- **Reset Cache impact**: Next analysis becomes full (one-time cost)

**Content Processing:**
- **Full Analysis**: Processes 100% of content files
- **Incremental**: Processes only changed files (often 0-20%)
- **Correlation Updates**: Only affected temporal windows recalculated
- **Memory Usage**: Lower memory footprint for large content collections

**Advanced Features to Test:**

**Correlation Intelligence:**
1. **Temporal Windowing**: Related moments within 14-day windows get correlation updates
2. **Impact Score Boosting**: Highly correlated moments (>60% similarity) get impact score increases
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Based on entity overlap, factor alignment, and keyword matching
4. **Detailed Reasoning**: Console logs show correlation strength and reasoning

**Configuration Options:**
```yaml
# Test different temporal window sizes
incremental:
  temporal_window_days: 14  # Try 7, 14, 21, 30 days
  correlation_threshold: 0.6  # Adjust similarity threshold
  force_full_analysis: false  # Override incremental behavior
```

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Smart Update processes only changed content (significant time savings)
- ‚úÖ No-change analysis completes in < 5 seconds
- ‚úÖ Existing moments preserved during incremental analysis  
- ‚úÖ New moments properly integrated with existing correlation network
- ‚úÖ Temporal correlation windows update affected moments only
- ‚úÖ Impact scores adjust based on new correlations
- ‚úÖ Incremental stats display accurate tracking information
- ‚úÖ Cache reset forces full analysis on next run
- ‚úÖ User interface clearly distinguishes incremental vs full analysis options

**Common Issues to Watch For:**

**Performance Issues:**
- Smart Update taking too long (should be < 15 seconds for typical changes)
- Memory leaks during repeated incremental analysis
- Excessive correlation calculations in temporal windows

**Data Integrity Issues:**
- Missing moments after incremental analysis
- Duplicated moments appearing in results  
- Correlation relationships lost during updates
- Impact scores not updating based on new correlations

**UI/UX Issues:**
- Incremental status card not reflecting actual state
- Button states confusing (when to use Smart Update vs Full Refresh)
- Status messages unclear during incremental processing

**Troubleshooting Guide:**

**Issue: Smart Update Not Working**
- Check browser console for change detection errors
- Verify content files have actual changes (timestamps, content)
- Try "Reset Cache" and run analysis again
- Compare content hashes in localStorage for debugging

**Issue: Poor Performance**
- Check if temporal correlation window is too large
- Verify not processing unchanged content (check console logs)  
- Monitor memory usage during analysis
- Consider clearing incremental cache for fresh start

**Issue: Missing Correlations**
- Ensure temporal window captures related moments timeframe
- Check correlation threshold isn't too restrictive
- Verify entity and factor overlap detection working
- Test with "Full Refresh" to establish complete correlation baseline

**Integration with File System:**
- Incremental analysis respects file-system-first persistence
- Content hashes track both file modifications and timestamps  
- Changes to moment files trigger correlation recalculation
- Manual file editing detected and processed incrementally

This incremental analysis system transforms Moments from a static batch processor into an intelligent, efficient analysis platform that scales gracefully with large content collections while maintaining analysis quality and correlation accuracy.

### Testing Parallel Processing Optimization

The latest update introduces comprehensive parallel processing optimization that dramatically improves moments analysis performance through concurrent execution.

#### 16. Parallel Processing Architecture

**What's New:**
- **Concurrent Analysis**: Companies and technologies now process simultaneously instead of sequentially
- **Parallel Content Processing**: Individual content files within each source process in parallel batches
- **Sub-Agent Parallelization**: Classification and correlation sub-agents run concurrently 
- **Configuration-Driven**: All parallel processing behavior is configurable via `config.yml`

**Performance Improvements to Test:**

**Scenario 1: Analysis Speed Comparison**
1. **Before Optimization**: Previous sequential processing (if available via config)
2. **After Optimization**: New parallel processing (default behavior)
3. **Expected Results**: 
   - **Small datasets (3-5 companies)**: 40-60% faster
   - **Medium datasets (5-10 companies)**: 60-80% faster
   - **Large datasets (10+ companies)**: 70-90% faster

**Scenario 2: Parallel Configuration Testing**
1. **Modify config.yml** parallel processing settings:
```yaml
app:
  processing:
    parallel_processing:
      enabled: true
      max_concurrent_sources: 4        # Process 4 companies/technologies simultaneously
      max_concurrent_content_per_source: 3  # Process 3 files per source in parallel
      enable_sub_agent_parallelization: true  # Run sub-agents concurrently
      sub_agent_batch_size: 10         # Batch size for classification/correlation
```

2. **Test Different Settings**:
   - Try `max_concurrent_sources: 2` vs `4` vs `6`
   - Test `max_concurrent_content_per_source: 1` (sequential) vs `3` (parallel)
   - Compare `enable_sub_agent_parallelization: false` vs `true`

**Scenario 3: Real-Time Performance Monitoring**
1. **Watch Analysis Progress**: Observe console logs during analysis
2. **Parallel Indicators**: Look for messages like:
   - `"Processing 2 source types in parallel"`
   - `"Parallel classification completed: X items"`
   - `"Sub-agent enhancement completed in parallel"`
3. **Performance Metrics**: Monitor browser dev tools for concurrent API calls

**Sub-Agent Parallelization Testing:**

**Classification + Correlation Concurrency:**
1. **Parallel Mode** (default): Both classification and correlation sub-agents run simultaneously
2. **Sequential Mode**: Sub-agents run one after another (configurable fallback)
3. **Batch Processing**: Large moment sets processed in configurable batches (10-15 items)

**Expected Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Faster Analysis**: 40-90% reduction in total analysis time
- ‚úÖ **Better Resource Usage**: Efficient utilization of API rate limits
- ‚úÖ **Scalable Performance**: Performance improvements increase with dataset size  
- ‚úÖ **Configurable Behavior**: Fine-tune parallel settings for your hardware/API limits
- ‚úÖ **Backward Compatibility**: Sequential mode available as fallback option

**Performance Monitoring:**

**Browser Console Indicators:**
```
[ParallelAnalysis] Parallel processing enabled
[ParallelAnalysis] Processing 2 source types
[MomentExtractor] Processing 5 items in parallel (max 3 concurrent)
[SubAgents] Parallel classification completed: 15 items
[SubAgents] Parallel correlation analysis completed: 12 correlations
```

**Configuration Options to Test:**

**Rate Limiting Configuration:**
```yaml
api_rate_limiting:
  requests_per_minute: 120    # Stay within API limits
  concurrent_requests: 10     # Max simultaneous API calls
```

**Agent-Specific Parallel Settings:**
```yaml
agents:
  classification_agent:
    parallel_batch_size: 10
    enable_parallel_batches: true
  correlation_engine:
    parallel_batch_size: 15
    enable_parallel_batches: true
```

**Troubleshooting Parallel Processing:**

**Issue: No Performance Improvement**
- Check `parallel_processing.enabled: true` in config.yml
- Verify you have enough content to benefit from parallelization
- Monitor API rate limiting - may need to adjust concurrent_requests
- Test with different batch sizes for optimal performance

**Issue: API Rate Limiting Errors**
- Reduce `max_concurrent_sources` or `max_concurrent_content_per_source`
- Lower `concurrent_requests` in rate limiting configuration
- Enable `enable_sub_agent_parallelization: false` to reduce concurrent calls

**Issue: Inconsistent Results**
- Parallel processing should produce identical results to sequential
- Try `enable_sub_agent_parallelization: false` to isolate issues
- Check browser console for processing errors or warnings
- Compare results with sequential mode for validation

**Advanced Features:**

**Intelligent Fallback:**
- Automatic fallback to sequential processing if parallel fails
- Graceful error handling with detailed logging
- Configurable retry logic for failed parallel operations

**Performance Scaling:**
- Linear performance improvement with additional concurrent sources
- Optimal batch sizes automatically calculated based on content size
- Dynamic adjustment based on API response times

**Integration Testing:**
- Parallel processing works with all existing features
- Incremental analysis benefits from parallel processing
- File-system persistence maintains performance gains
- Storage manager reflects parallel processing status

This parallel processing optimization ensures Moments scales efficiently with large content collections while maintaining analysis accuracy and providing comprehensive configuration options for different deployment scenarios and API rate limits.
