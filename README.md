### Testing Data Persistence & Recovery Features

The latest update includes robust data persistence and recovery mechanisms to ensure your catalogs and moments data remain available across browser sessions.

#### 7. Storage Management System

**What to Test:**
- **Storage Health Monitor**: Check available storage space and health status
- **Backup/Restore**: Export and import complete application state
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automatic data restoration on app startup
- **Storage Inspection**: Debug and monitor stored data

**How to Access:**
1. Click the settings/cog icon in the header (next to folder selection)
2. Storage Manager panel expands with complete storage controls

**Storage Manager Features:**
- **Health Status**: Green checkmark = healthy, Red warning = issues
- **Space Usage**: Shows KB used and percentage of available storage
- **Current State**: Displays loaded companies, technologies, and moments counts
- **Backup Button**: Downloads complete state as JSON file
- **Restore Button**: Upload previous backup to restore state
- **Inspect Button**: Logs detailed storage info to browser console
- **Check Health**: Re-runs storage diagnostics
- **Refresh Page**: Force reload with fresh hydration
- **Clear All**: Remove all stored data (with confirmation)

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Storage health shows accurate status and metrics
- ‚úÖ Backup creates downloadable JSON with timestamp
- ‚úÖ Restore successfully loads previous state from backup
- ‚úÖ Storage persists after closing/reopening browser
- ‚úÖ Auto-recovery status badge shows in header

#### 8. Data Persistence Testing

**Test Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Basic Persistence**
1. Load catalogs and generate moments
2. Note the counts (e.g., 3 companies, 3 technologies, 20 moments)
3. Close browser completely
4. Reopen browser and navigate to app
5. Verify all data is restored automatically

**Scenario 2: Extended Session**
1. Load data and generate moments
2. Leave browser open for 8+ hours or overnight
3. Return to app and verify data still present
4. If missing, check auto-recovery status in header

**Scenario 3: Backup and Restore**
1. Create full dataset with catalogs and moments
2. Click Storage Manager ‚Üí Backup
3. Save the JSON file
4. Clear all data using "Clear All" button
5. Restore from backup file
6. Verify complete restoration

**Scenario 4: Auto-Recovery**
1. Load catalogs (but don't generate moments)
2. Close browser
3. Reopen and watch for recovery status badge
4. Should show "Rehydrating catalogs..." then "Recovery complete"
5. Verify catalogs are restored

**Expected Behavior:**
- Data persists indefinitely until manually cleared
- Auto-recovery runs within 500ms of app load
- Recovery status shows in header during process
- Corrupted data is automatically cleared and reported
- Version tracking enables future migrations

#### 9. Storage Debugging

**Console Commands for Debugging:**

Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
// Inspect all stored data
localStorage.getItem('moments-catalog-store')
localStorage.getItem('moments-store')

// Check storage size
new Blob(Object.values(localStorage)).size
```

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

**Issue: Data disappears after session**
- Check browser privacy settings (disable "Clear on exit")
- Verify localStorage is not blocked
- Check Storage Manager health status
- Try backup/restore as workaround

**Issue: Auto-recovery not working**
- Check recovery status badge in header
- Open console for detailed recovery logs
- Verify folder paths still exist
- Use Storage Manager to manually reload

**Issue: Storage quota exceeded**
- Check Storage Manager for space usage
- Clear old moments before generating new ones
- Use backup to save important data externally
- Consider using multiple browser profiles

**Performance Metrics:**
- Storage operations: < 100ms
- Auto-recovery: < 2s on app startup
- Backup/restore: < 500ms for typical datasets
- Health check: < 50ms response time
