Component-by-Component (concise)
Ingestion Gateway

Accepts: RSS/Atom, webhooks, APIs, file uploads, email drops.

Dedupe via URL hash + shingling; retain canonical.

Preprocess

Normalize (HTML → text), detect/translate to EN, split into semantic chunks (≈1–3k tokens).

Create embeddings (e.g., text-embedding-3-large or Bedrock Titan).

Entity & Event Extraction

NER: orgs, people, products, models, geos, markets.

Event triples: (actor, action, object, qualifiers, time).

Output confidence, provenance (paragraph offsets).

Factor Classifier (Hybrid)

Rules: fast keyword+pattern match (e.g., Series [A-G], acquires, sanction).

ML: fine-tuned classifier on labeled “pivotal moments” (micro/macro + category).

Meta: ensemble calibration (Platt/temperature scaling), abstain below τ.

Enrichment

Join to Knowledge Graph (companies↔partners↔competitors↔suppliers↔regs↔tech).

Historical analogs: fetch past N similar events for priors.

Sentiment/stance; estimate directionality (risk vs opportunity).

Correlation Engine

Temporal windowing (e.g., 7–14 days) with decay.

Entity overlap (Jaccard on entities; strong links weighted).

Factor cross-links (macro→micro bridges: regulation→product→customer).

Output: clusters (“moments”) with lineage to source events.

Impact Scoring (0–100)

Breadth (entities/markets impacted)

Depth (financial/operational proxy from historical analogs)

Urgency (time-to-act; regulatory deadlines; competitive SLAs)

Momentum (coverage velocity; social lift)

Strategic Fit (user watchlists: accounts, tech, geos)

Final = weighted sum + business-specific modifiers (e.g., target accounts +10%)

Storage

Events (Postgres), Vectors (pgvector/OpenSearch), Graph (Neo4j/Neptune), Blobs (S3).

Indexes for: full-text, vector, graph traversals, and time-range queries.

Immutable provenance: store raw snippet + hash for audit.

UX/API

Search: keyword + vector + filter by micro/macro/factor/entity/date.

Dashboards: live “heat map” of moments by factor; watchlists.

Alerts: rules (“If competitor + customer-loss + high score → Slack/Email”).

Actions: playbooks (e.g., create CRM task, draft outreach, brief PDF).

Minimal Data Contracts (schemas)
Event (ingested unit)

{
  "event_id": "EVT-...",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-10T01:23:45Z",
  "source": {"url": "...", "publisher": "...", "section": "..."},

  "entities": [{"type":"company","name":"Acme AI","qid":"..."}],
  "event_triple": {"actor":"Acme AI","action":"acquires","object":"ChipCo"},
  "factors": [{"type":"micro","category":"M&A","confidence":0.92}],
  "embeddings": {"model":"...", "vec":[...]},
  "hash":"..."
}
Moment (cluster)

Edit
{
  "moment_id":"MNT-...",
  "time_window":{"start":"...","end":"..."},
  "micro_factors":["M&A","Partnerships"],
  "macro_factors":["Regulatory: Privacy"],
  "entities":["Acme AI","ChipCo","EU"],
  "impact":{"risk":22,"opportunity":81,"composite":86},
  "members":["EVT-1","EVT-7","EVT-9"],
  "provenance":{"explanations":[{"member":"EVT-7","why":"new EU AI rule + product pivot"}]}
}
Lightweight Logic (readable pseudocode)

def classify_factors(event):
    rule_hits = rules_match(event.text)
    ml_pred = classifier.predict(event.features)
    if ml_pred.conf < 0.55 and not rule_hits:
        return abstain()
    return fuse(rule_hits, ml_pred)  # calibrate, de-dupe, rank

def correlate(events_window):
    G = build_entity_graph(events_window)
    clusters = community_detect(G, min_cohesion=τc)
    return [attach_macro_micro_links(c) for c in clusters]

def score(moment):
    f = features(moment)  # breadth, depth, urgency, momentum, fit
    base = 100 * (0.25*f.breadth + 0.30*f.depth + 0.20*f.urgency + 0.15*f.momentum + 0.10*f.fit)
    return clamp(base + business_modifiers(moment), 0, 100)

Ops & Quality Guardrails
Dedupe & contradict checks: avoid double-alerting; detect retractions/updates.

Model drift watch: weekly eval on golden set; alert if F1 drops >3 pts.

Explainability: store factor highlights (key sentences) for each tag.

Privacy/compliance: respect robots.txt, license flags, and data residency.
