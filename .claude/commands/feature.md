Think harder to perform these steps:

1. Read the project code (src/ ) to understand the state of the project
2. Read the backlog/ folder to understand the project backlog
3. Read the specs/ folder to understand the architecture and design specifications for this project
5. Add the next logical [ ] item in the active backlog/ backlog file
