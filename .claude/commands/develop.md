Think harder to perform these tasks:
1. Read the project code (src/ ) and tests (tests/) to understand the state of the project
2. Read the backlog/ folder to understand the project backlog
3. Pick the next open [ ] backlog item. If multiple open items are present only pick one next in sequence.
4. Develop the open backlog item.
5. Once backlog item is generated mark it complete [x] and appending below the item a completion summary
6. Update README.md with user evaluation guide for project features completed
