Think harder to perform these tasks:
1. Read the project code (src/ ) to understand the state of the project
2. Read the backlog/ folder to understand the project backlog
3. If $ARGUMENTS does not specify the backlog file to use then use the backlog file greater in sequence (e.g, 002-backlog > 001-backlog) 
4. Pick the next open [ ] backlog item. If multiple open items are present only pick one next in sequence.
5. Develop the open backlog item.
6. Once backlog item is generated mark it complete [x] and appending below the item a completion summary
7. Update README.md with user evaluation guide for project features completed
