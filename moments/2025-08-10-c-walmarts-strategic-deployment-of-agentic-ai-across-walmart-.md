Our approach to agentic AI at Walmart is surgical. Extensive early testing proved that, for us, agents work best when deployed for highly specific tasks, to produce outputs that can then be stitched together to orchestrate and solve complex workflows. We leverage our retail-specific LLM to build agents for tasks such as item comparison, deep personalization, shopping journey completion, etc. within our GenAI-powered shopping assistant.
