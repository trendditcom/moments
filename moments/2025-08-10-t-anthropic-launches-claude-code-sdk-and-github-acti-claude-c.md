## Original Content

```
What is the cloud code SDK? It is a way to programmatically access the power of the cloud code agent in headless mode. Uh this is powerful because uh it's a new kind of primitive and a new kind of building block that allows you to build applications that just weren't possible before... cloud GitHub action was built on top of the SDK um and it can be used to uh review code. It can be used to create new features. It can be used to u triage bugs and so on. Um and uh this is also open source.
