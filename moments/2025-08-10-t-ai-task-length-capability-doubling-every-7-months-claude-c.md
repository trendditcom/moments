The length of tasks that AI can do is doubling every seven months. Right now we're at about an hour. And that's fine. You don't need to vibe code. You can have cursor work for you. You can have clawed code write a feature that would take an hour. Um, and you can review all that code and you can be still be intimately involved uh, as the AI is writing a lot of your code. But what happens next year? What happens the year after that? When the AI is powerful enough that it can be generating an entire day's worth of work for you at a time or an entire week's worth of work
