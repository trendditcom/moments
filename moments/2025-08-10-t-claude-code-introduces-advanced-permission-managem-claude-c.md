it's d-permission prompt tool... what if you didn't want to do them because you don't know what tools cloud wants to what tool tools cloud would want to use in the future? Um, in that case, you can use the d-p permission prompt tool and offload the permission management to an to an MCP server... when you call cloud-p in in structured output or JSON mode, it's going to return a session ID. Uh and this session ID is useful because you can then reference the session ID to go back to the same context state
