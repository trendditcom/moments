# Backlog 001

1. [x] You are an expert engineer from Claude Code team at Anthropic. Create CLAUDE.md for this project using following context:
   - Project contains source code in src/ folder and tests in tests/ folder
   - The project has an app called Moments (in src/ folder)
   - Moments is a local-first, agent driven app and built as a wrapper of https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk
   - Project contains several content (markdown, images) related folders like companies/ and technologies/ which may be referred by the Moments app 
   - The project also contains Claude Code specific folders and files which are reusable by the Moments app via the Claude Code SDK
   - The project features backlog is defined in backlog/ folder
   - Each code generation for this project follows a feature-slice approach generating a working, usable feature
   - IMPORTANT: This project does not create any mock, hardcoded, prototype, or fake features or fallbacks
   - If feature fails then a descriptive error message and debug log is created to help Claude Code iterate on the fix
   - Moments app discovers pivotal moments in the business of AI as these apply to top 100 most valued AI startups and Fortune 100 enterprises managing disruption caused by AI
   - Moments app creates signal from noise by classifying and correlating these pivotal moments around micro factors (company, competition, partners, customer) and macro factors (economic, geo-political, regulation, technology, environment, supply chain, etc.)
   
   **Completion Summary**: Successfully created comprehensive CLAUDE.md file with project overview, structure documentation, development principles (feature-slice approach, no mocks/prototypes), code generation guidelines, and backlog management instructions. The file serves as the central project documentation and development guide for the Moments application.

2. [x] Understand the best practicies of using Claude Code at https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices. Apply these best practices to CLAUDE.md based on the goals of Moments app
   
   **Completion Summary**: Successfully integrated comprehensive Claude Code best practices into CLAUDE.md including: 1) Development Workflow with Explore-Plan-Code-Commit approach and TDD guidelines, 2) Environment Setup with required tools and configuration, 3) Claude Code Optimization Techniques for effective communication and tool usage, 4) Advanced Development Patterns including parallel development and headless mode, 5) Code Style and Testing Guidelines specific to AI analysis features, and 6) Key development principle emphasizing clear targets for iteration. The enhanced documentation now provides detailed guidance for efficient Claude Code usage tailored to the Moments app's AI-driven development needs.
   
3. [x] Add these Claude Code documentation links as reference for this project and update CLAUDE.md with these:
   - https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview
   - https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/quickstart
   - https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/common-workflows
   - https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks-guide
   - https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp
   - https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/amazon-bedrock
   
   **Completion Summary**: Successfully added comprehensive Claude Code Documentation References section to CLAUDE.md including: 1) Essential Claude Code Resources with all 6 required documentation links (Overview, Quickstart, Common Workflows, Hooks Guide, MCP, Amazon Bedrock), 2) Integration Notes specific to Moments app goals including AI startup data analysis pipelines, automated content discovery hooks, external API connections via MCP, and enterprise scaling considerations. The documentation provides clear reference points for development teams and contextualizes each resource within the Moments application architecture.
   

4. [x] Add these vibe coding, agents, and headless claude code best practices for this project and update CLAUDE.md with these:
   - @technologies/claude-code/headless-claude-code.md
   - https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk
   - https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents
   - @technologies/claude-code/vibe-coding-prod.md
   - https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents
   
   **Completion Summary**: Successfully integrated comprehensive advanced Claude Code best practices into CLAUDE.md including: 1) **Headless Automation** section with SDK integration patterns, Unix tool philosophy, CI automation capabilities, and structured output for programmatic parsing, 2) **Vibe Coding Best Practices** section implementing Eric Breck's production methodology with "forget the code, not the product" philosophy, leaf node focus strategy, verification-first approach, and Claude-as-PM patterns, 3) **Effective Agent Development Principles** section covering Anthropic's methodology with simplicity-first approach, agent vs workflow distinction, sub-agent configuration for specialized tasks (Content Analyzer, Classification Agent, Correlation Engine, Report Generator), and SDK implementation patterns with multi-turn conversations. Updated Environment Setup and Advanced Development Patterns sections to reflect headless automation, vibe coding workflows, session management, and sub-agent orchestration capabilities. The enhanced documentation now provides production-ready guidance for responsible AI-driven development using cutting-edge Claude Code capabilities.

5. [x] Based on the Moments app goals and documentation available to CLAUDE.md create an architecture and technology stack specification in specs/stack.md following best practices for modern AI first app architecture. Update CLAUDE.md with IMPORTANT prefix to refer to specs/stack.md when building Moments app architecture and stack.

   **Completion Summary**: Successfully created comprehensive architecture and technology stack specification in `specs/stack.md` including: 1) **System Architecture** with 4-layer design (Presentation, Agent Orchestration, Data Processing, Storage & Integration), 2) **Technology Stack** covering Frontend (Next.js 14+, React 18+, TypeScript 5+, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui), Backend (Claude Code SDK, tRPC, Prisma, SQLite), AI Technologies (specialized sub-agents with TypeScript interfaces, content processing pipeline), Development Tools (Vite, ESLint, Jest/Vitest, Playwright), and CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Claude Code Headless), 3) **Sub-Agent Specifications** with detailed configurations for Content Analyzer, Classification Agent, Correlation Engine, and Report Generator, 4) **Data Models** with SQLite schema for moments, companies, and correlations, 5) **Security & Performance** strategies for local-first optimization, memory management, and data privacy, 6) **Integration Patterns** including MCP server configurations and Claude Code SDK multi-turn conversation examples. Updated CLAUDE.md with IMPORTANT prefix directing developers to reference specs/stack.md for all architecture and technology stack decisions, ensuring consistent implementation following modern AI-first design principles.

6. Based on the Moments app goals, documentation available to CLAUDE.md, and specs/stack.md architecture and stack create a user interface design specification in specs/design.md following best practices for modern AI first app design. Update CLAUDE.md with IMPORTANT prefix to refer to specs/design.md when building Moments app user experience.
