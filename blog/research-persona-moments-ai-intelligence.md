## The Research Intelligence Revolution

The AI market moves at breakneck speed. While your competitors are still manually parsing news feeds and quarterly reports, forward-thinking research teams are leveraging AI agents to automatically surface pivotal business moments before they become obvious trends.

**Moments** represents the next evolution in AI-powered business intelligence—a local-first application that discovers, classifies, and correlates breakthrough moments across the top 100 AI startups and Fortune 100 enterprises managing AI disruption.

## Beyond Traditional Market Research

### The Signal vs. Noise Challenge

Traditional research methodologies struggle with AI market dynamics:
- **Volume Overload**: 10,000+ AI-related announcements weekly across startups and enterprises
- **Context Fragmentation**: Critical insights scattered across filings, blogs, podcasts, and social feeds  
- **Correlation Blindness**: Missing connections between seemingly unrelated events
- **Temporal Lag**: Discovering trends weeks after competitive advantage expires

Moments solves this through sophisticated **factor classification** that automatically categorizes business events into:

**Micro Factors** (Company-Level Intelligence):
- Leadership transitions and key hires
- Product launches and AI model releases
- Strategic partnerships and customer wins
- Competitive positioning and market pivots

**Macro Factors** (Industry-Level Dynamics):
- Regulatory developments (EU AI Act, privacy laws)
- Economic shifts affecting AI investment
- Geopolitical tensions impacting supply chains
- Technology breakthroughs reshaping competitive landscapes

## The Moments Architecture Advantage

- **Research Reproducibility**: Versionable analysis workflows and findings

## Research Workflow Transformation

### Before Moments: Manual Research Bottlenecks

Research teams typically spend 60-80% of their time on data collection rather than strategic analysis:

```
Week 1-2: Manual source monitoring across 20+ publications
Week 3: Spreadsheet correlation attempts  
Week 4: PowerPoint synthesis and executive reporting
Result: 4-week lag on market intelligence
```

### After Moments: AI-Accelerated Insights

**Regulatory Correlations**: "EU AI Act developments trigger 40% increase in AI governance hiring across Fortune 100 enterprises"

### Impact Scoring Algorithm

Each moment receives a composite impact score (0-100) based on:
- **Breadth**: Number of entities/markets affected  
- **Depth**: Historical financial/operational impact
- **Urgency**: Time-sensitive competitive implications
- **Momentum**: Coverage velocity and market attention
- **Strategic Fit**: Alignment with research focus areas

## Research Team ROI
