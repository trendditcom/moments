## Multi-Dimensional Factor Visualization

The Factor Distribution Analytics component transforms complex AI business data into intuitive visual insights through two complementary visualization techniques:

### Interactive Sunburst Chart: Three-Ring Factor Hierarchy

The **Factor Classification Sunburst** provides hierarchical visualization of micro and macro factors affecting AI industry moments:

**Inner Ring: Factor Categories**
- **Micro Factors (Blue)**: Company-specific influences including competitive dynamics, partnership ecosystems, and customer relationships
- **Macro Factors (Green)**: Systemic influences including economic conditions, geopolitical events, regulatory changes, and technology breakthroughs

**Middle Ring: Factor Types**  
Detailed categorization within micro/macro divisions showing specific factor types and their relative impact distribution

**Outer Ring: Specific Factors**
Granular factor identification with interactive hover details and click-to-zoom exploration capabilities

### Impact Distribution Heatmap: Factor-Impact Correlation Matrix

The **Impact Distribution Heatmap** reveals correlation patterns between factor categories and impact levels:

- **Technology Factors**: 58 high-impact moments, showing dominant influence of AI technology breakthroughs
- **Company Factors**: 47 high-impact moments, indicating significant corporate-driven market changes  
- **Economic Factors**: 9 high-impact moments, representing macro-economic influences
- **Regulatory Factors**: 9 high-impact moments, tracking policy and compliance impacts

**Interactive Analysis Features:**
- **Color-intensity mapping** based on moment counts per factor-impact combination
- **Category filtering** (All/Micro/Macro factors) for focused analysis
- **Cell-based interaction** revealing detailed correlation statistics
- **Export functionality** for external analysis and reporting

## AI-Generated Pattern Recognition

The analytics engine automatically generates insights from factor distribution patterns:

### Micro Factor Analysis
> "Micro factors show higher variance in impact distribution, with company-specific developments creating both high-impact strategic shifts and numerous low-impact operational changes."

### Macro Factor Analysis  
> "Macro factors demonstrate systematic market influence, with technology breakthroughs and regulatory changes consistently generating medium to high-impact moments across the AI industry."

### Mixed Factor Insights
> "Analysis reveals both company-specific innovations and systemic technology adoption driving the most significant pivotal moments in AI industry evolution."

## Advanced Statistical Analysis

**Comprehensive Factor Statistics:**
- **80 Total Moments** analyzed across all factor categories
- **9 Active Factors** currently showing significant activity
- **81 Average Impact Score** indicating high-velocity AI industry environment

**Impact Distribution Breakdown:**
- **High Impact**: Technology (58), Company (47), Economic (9), Regulation (9)
- **Medium Impact**: Strategic partnerships (15), competitive dynamics (12)  
- **Emerging Patterns**: Supply chain (4), geopolitical (3), competitive (2)

## Professional Data Visualization Features

### Interactive Exploration
- **Click-to-zoom** sunburst navigation for detailed factor exploration
- **Hover tooltips** with comprehensive factor statistics and classifications
